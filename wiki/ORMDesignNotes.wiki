The rough direction I'd like to explore for an iPhone-capable ORM (built as an additional library, with PLDatabase):
  * Support for parsing of Xcode-created CoreData model definitions.
  * An API that, using the CoreData model definitions, handles wiring of object properties from/to the database values for individual objects.
  * Relationship support, loading with incremental support for loading subobjects.
